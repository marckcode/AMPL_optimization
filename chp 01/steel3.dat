# In reality, a whole product line cannot be shut down solely to 
# increase weekly profits. The simplest way to reflect this in 
# the model is to add lower bounds on the production amounts. 
# We have declared a new collection of parameters named commit, 
# to represent the lower bounds on production that are imposed by 
# sales commitments, and we have changed >= 0 to >= commit[p] in the
# declaration of the variables Make[p].
