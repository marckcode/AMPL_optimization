# Profits have increased compared to the two-variable version.
# On closer examination, this result is not so surprising. Plate yields a profit of $4640 per hour, which is less than for bands but more than for coils. Thus plate is
# produced to absorb the capacity not taken by bands; coils 
# would be produced only if both bands and plate reached their 
# market limits before the available hours were exhausted.
